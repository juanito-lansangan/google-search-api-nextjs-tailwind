            "dc.description": "A compound cell for performing an electrochemical reaction at high temperature consists essentially of hollow, cylindrical bodies of a ceramic electrolyte, rings of an electronically conductive material coaxially interposed between each pair of electrolyte bodies, annular layers of ceramic insulating material bonding each ring to at least one of the two adjacent electrolyte bodies, the bodies, rings, and annular layers being diffusion welded to each other to form a cylindrical, gas-tight tube. A pair of electrode layers is associated with each electrolyte body, one layer of the pair covering the associated body inside the tube and conductively engaging one of the two adjacent rings, the other electrode layer of the pair covering the associated body outside the tube and conductively engaging the other adjacent ring.",
